# Comprehensive Analysis of Ticket Data: Insights and Recommendations
---

## **1. Key Observations**

### **Ticket Volume by ORDER_TYPE**
- **Dominance of <strong>Quick Tickets</strong>**: Quick tickets account for the majority of ticket volume, significantly outnumbering tasks.  
- **Business Implication**: The high volume of quick tickets suggests a need for streamlined processes, automation, and self-service solutions to reduce agent workload and improve response times.

---

### **Average Resolution Time by ORDER_TYPE**
- **Resolution Times**:
  - Quick tickets: ~28 minutes.
  - Tasks: ~60 minutes (nearly double the time).
- **Business Implication**: While quick tickets are resolved faster, their high volume means small improvements in resolution time can have a significant impact. Tasks require attention to reduce complexity or streamline workflows.

---

### **Top Customers by Ticket Type**
- **High Ticket Volume for Top Customers**: Each of the top three customers generates ~14 tickets, dominated by quick tickets.
- **Business Implication**: High-engagement customers may encounter recurring issues. Addressing root causes through proactive measures and personalized support can improve satisfaction and loyalty.

---

### **HDW Issue Resolution Distribution**
- **Uniform Distribution**: All resolution methods (e.g., router restarts, firmware updates) represent ~8% of HDW tickets.
- **Business Implication**: No single resolution method dominates, indicating diverse hardware issues. Training technicians must not be oriented in one method. Training on all methods and automating repetitive resolutions can improve efficiency.

---

### **SOP Issue Resolution Distribution**
- **Dominance of SIT12**: 50% of SOP tickets are resolved via SIT12, with TITAN-related outcomes (successful, aborted, rejected) equally distributed at 17% each.
- **Business Implication**: Investigate why SIT12 is so prevalent and whether it can be optimized or replaced. Improve TITAN success rates.

---

### **WLAN Issue Pie Chart**
- **Dominance of WLAN Issues**: WLAN issues account for the largest share of tickets, followed by "Other" and smaller categories like billing and modem activation.
- **Business Implication**: WLAN issues are a critical pain point. Addressing root causes (e.g., connectivity problems, user errors) will significantly improve customer satisfaction and reduce ticket volume.

---

### **Team Performance**
- **Ticket Distribution**:
  - HDW: 33.3%.
  - SOP: 14.3%.
  - Other categories: Smaller shares collectively totaling 52.4%.
- **Resolution Times**:
  - High-complexity actions (e.g., SIT12): ~60 minutes.
  - Low-complexity actions (e.g., Smartcard Replaced): ~15-20 minutes.
- **Business Implication**: Teams handling high-complexity actions (e.g., KAV, GIGA) require additional resources and training. Best practices from teams handling low-complexity actions can inform process improvements.

---

### **Ticket Volume by Day of Week**
- **Peak Days**: Tuesday and Wednesday see the highest ticket volumes (~8 tickets/day).
- **Weekend**: Saturday and Sunday have significantly lower volumes (~3-5 tickets/day).
- **Business Implication**: Optimize staffing levels during peak days and consider reduced schedules on weekends to manage costs effectively.

---

### **Ticket Volume by Hour of Day**
- **Peak Hour**: 11 AM has the highest ticket volume (~9 tickets).
- **Decline Afternoon**: Ticket volume decreases after 11 AM, with the lowest activity at 2 PM (~2 tickets).
- **Business Implication**: Allocate more resources during morning hours (8 AMâ€“11 AM) and explore automation/self-service options to handle spikes efficiently.

---

### **Error and Escalation Trends**
- **Unknown Tickets**: ~22 tickets lack proper categorization.
- **Success Rate**: ~11 tickets successfully resolved.
- **Errors and Escalations**: ~4 tickets each fall into error or technician escalation categories.
- **Business Implication**: Address data quality issues to reduce unknown tickets. Analyze errors and escalations to identify gaps in initial troubleshooting and resource allocation.

---

## **2. Actionable Recommendations**

### **Operational Efficiency**
1. **Automate Quick Tickets**:
   - Implement chatbots, FAQs, and automated workflows to handle routine quick tickets, reducing agent workload and resolution times.
2. **Streamline Task Handling**:
   - Break down tasks into manageable steps and assign specialized teams or tools to handle them efficiently.

### **Resource Allocation**
3. **Optimize Staffing**:
   - Increase staffing during peak periods (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and mornings) and reduce resources during low-volume periods (weekends, afternoons).
4. **Enhance Technician Training**:
   - Train technicians on all resolution methods and provide advanced training for high-complexity actions like SIT12.

### **Customer Satisfaction**
5. **Proactive Issue Resolution**:
   - Use predictive analytics to identify and address recurring WLAN issues before they impact customers.
6. **Personalized Support for Top Customers**:
   - Assign dedicated account managers or specialists to high-ticket customers to ensure timely and effective issue resolution.

### **Data Quality and Process Improvement**
7. **Reduce Unknown Tickets**:
   - Enforce strict categorization guidelines and implement automated tools to ensure accurate tracking of ticket outcomes.
8. **Analyze Errors and Escalations**:
   - Investigate root causes of errors and escalations to refine initial troubleshooting processes and reduce the need for escalation.
